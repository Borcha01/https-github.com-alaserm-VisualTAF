# ExlJS (the tool that does most of the work for you in data-driven test automation)
ExlJS is a simple, but powerful tool for rapid and easy creation of **data-driven** test automation scripts. It's data-driven out of the box, no need to write code for fetching test data. ExlJS allows composition of test cases in EXCEL by **copy/pasting** reusable instructions in one Excel sheet and feeding them with test data from another excel sheet in the same Excel file.
Also this tool allows you to cut your test execution time **tenfold** by running your tests in parallel in multiple browsers at the same time.\
This tool is designed to enforce **test automation best practices** like reusable data-driven instructions, object repository.
- It's a **standalone GUI tool**, no need to remember  command line parameters :)
- it uses **Javascript**, which is much easier to use than Java or C# code, **no compilation required**.
- *Tons of built-in convenience functions for all types of interactions with web elements, tons of built-in verification points, you don't need to write any extra code.*
- **No need** to download and install Node.js, Java, Selenium or other dependencies, the tool is self contained, just download this tool and you are all set, it works out of the box.
- Built-in **Object Repository** to keep all Web Elements of your tests in one place (test automation best practices for ease of maintenance in case web element selectors change later) 
- It supports parallel test exection on remote machines.
- It has sophisticated built-in functions to wait for page load in standard and SPA pages to make your test scripts rock stable.
- Automatically takes screeenshots upon test failure for easy defect reporting.
- Automatic Enterprise Level Reporting with drill down to step level (no need for you to write any code), you can see exactly what test data was used for each element and what button was clicked.
- **!!!New!!!** *Automatic code generation* - just fill in test data in datasheet and press **Ctrl+Shift+G** for the tool to auto generate code for you, this is a **MAGIC** shortcut, it will create instruction code, repository with web elements and commands to feed data to web elements from your Excel. IF code is already generated this shortcut will easy navigate you to instruction code or object repository element.
- **Save up to 70%** on your test automation development and maintenance time.
