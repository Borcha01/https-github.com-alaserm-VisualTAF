# ExlJS (the tool that does most of the work for you in data-driven test automation)
ExlJS is a simple, but powerful tool for rapid and easy creation of **MAINTAINABLE** keyword and data driven test automation scripts.
ExlJS allows assembly of test cases in EXCEL by **copy/pasting** instructions in Excel sheet and feeding them with test data from datasheets.
Also this tool allows you to cut your test execution time **tenfold** by running your tests in parallel in multiple browsers at the same time.\
This tool is designed to enforce **test automation best practices**, so there is no "record and playback" functionality or other features that are not used by *REAL life test automation experts* as they make scripts unmaintainable.
- It's a standalong GUI tool, it uses **Javascript**, which is much easier to use than Java or C#, no compilation required.
- **No need** to download and install Node.js, Java, Selenium or other dependencies, the tool is self contained, just download this tool and you are all set, it works out of the box.
- Built-in **Object Repository** to keep all Web Elements of your tests in one place (test automation best practices for ease of maintenance in case web element selectors change later) 
- It supports test exection on *Selenium Grid nodes* and/or local machine.
- It has sophisticated built-in functions to wait for page load in standard and SPA pages.
- Automatically takes screeenshots upon test failure for easy bug tracking.
- CI/CD integration: ExlJS exposes REST API that you can call from CI tools, like Jenkins, to start tests in pipeline.
- Enterprise level reporting with drill down to step level, charts, screenshots and more.
- **!!!New!!!** *API testing* is available now.
- **!!!New!!!** *Automatic code generation* - just fill in test data in datasheet and press **Ctrl+Shift+G** for the tool to auto generate code for you, this is a **MAGIC** shortcut, it will create instruction code, repository with web elements and commands to feed data to web elements from your Excel. IF code is already generated this shortcut will easy navigate you to places.
- **Save up to 70%** on your test automation development and maintenance time.
