# VisualTAF 

VisualTAF is a hybrid test automation framework for rapid and easy test case creation
Unlike other tools where you need complex XML configuration, VisualTAF allows creation of test cases in Excel by just copy/pasting instructions on one sheet and linking them to test data kept in separate sheet of the same Excel.
